# VaccineDiary: Algorithmic Protocol, E-card, Mobile App and Research Papers
We present an end to end decentralized protocol developed by MIT for the **secure and privacy preserving workflow of phased vaccination, vaccination status verification, and adverse reactions or symptoms reporting**. The proposed system improves the **efficiency, privacy, equity and effectiveness** by augmenting the existing systems such as VAMS, VAERS, v-safe and IIS.

We propose two user-facing solutions: 
* a modified vaccination card which carries digitally signed (QR) codes and a scanner app for health officials for data aggregation, 
* a mobile phone app for the user that interfaces with existing databases directly. We believe a user-centric design is critical in the micro-planning and last mile issues.

The userâ€™s journey is divided into four parts: 
1. Digitally enhanced enrollment system for phased vaccination
2. A privacy-preserving smartphone app to interface with vaccination sites without revealing any personally identifiable information to centralized servers 
3. Proof of vaccination in a privacy-preserving and secure manner 
4. Monitoring and alert systems for adverse reactions that enable users to upload their symptoms in a cryptographically secure manner. In addition, we need the ability to perform data aggregation for analytics without revealing raw data.

This repository is a compilation of Trusted Pandemic Technologies' efforts to design digital solutions that engage citizens in four core areas:
1. Logistics
2. Health Outcomes
3. User-centric impact
4. Communication.

>Our mission is to help public health professionals to instantly overcome challenging barriers they encounter as they engage citizens as an active participants in digital solutions for fighting COVID-19 and future pandemics.
Today, the program is focused on creating a citizen-centric solutions for the digital management of COVID-19 vaccine distribution, testing, and health verification. Previously the program worked with public health officials as they designed and deployed exposure notification and digital contact tracing solutions. Subsequent initiatives under consideration include surveillance, monitoring, and predictive modeling to better prepare us, as a society, for future pandemics.

The founding belief of the Trusted Pandemic Technologies is that when it comes to engaging citizens in a quest for the common good, especially public health, trust at all levels and among all participants is mandatory for success. So, the program builds on privacy-preserving systems for smartphone data, analytics, and machine learning.
